	abstract     = {Variety in music performance has been deemed a natural necessity on the part of practitioners [Godlovitch, 1988; Margulis, 2014; Smith, 1993]. In fact, a strive for variety has been noticed both in terms of performative patterns that vary throughout a given interpretation [Rink, Spiro, and Gold 2011] and across the multiple performances of a given piece [Fabian 2015; Fabian and Ornoy 2009; Llorens 2018; 2021b; Ornoy 2008]. However, in most studies its discussion has been relegated to tangential commentaries, and very rarely has it been the focus of research. To fill this lacuna, this article investigates the interpretive techniques by which eighteen cellists create a sense of variety in a highly regular musical context: the Prelude from J. S. Bach's Suite for cello solo no. 4 in E flat major. The analysis addresses three main issues in each recording: a) the varying durational proportions between the various notes within each bar and the patterns that emerge from it; b) the importance of dynamics in supporting, compensating, or even overruling the effect of a); and c) the relatively unstable approaches to the intonation of specific intervals in the Prelude. Ultimately, this research contributes new case studies to the theorisation of variety in the context of pseudo-perpetual motion music, unequivocally positing performance as a critical element in music theory.}

To that aim it has simply reproduced descriptions that overlook these musicians' sounds. In fact, it is no surprise that their recordings of Joaqu{\'i}n Rodrigo's Fantas{\'i}a para un gentilhombre {—}respectively from 1958 and 1987{—} bear witness to a different reality. Despite his exaggeration of the durational differences between the note values in some motifs, Segovia's agogic resources appear to respond to phraseological, metric, and harmonic preoccupations omitted in the literature. For his part, Bream, who becomes more irregular in constant-figuration passages, seems to adopt some techniques of historically informed performance. Through the analysis of the duration of notes, beats, sentences, and periods in both renditions, this case study demonstrates, thus, that a specific rendition may be the result of a complex web of motivations and influences. Ultimately, it exemplifies the necessity for the empirical analysis of musical performance in order to detect and understand the nuances that would otherwise remain silent.},

Due to that unparalleled success, it is possible to ascertain Spain and Portugal's participation in international, contemporary  tastes  and  artistic  webs,  applicable  to  both  composers and  performers.  However,  this  internationalisation  needs  to  be  nuanced, as some characteristics of the repertoire specifically written for the Peninsula indicate that their court audiences may have had expectations, both social and strictly musical, different from those of the public in  opera  theatres  elsewhere  in  the  continent.  In  this  light,  this  article investigates in what ways the style of five composers in the international scene {—}Perez, Galuppi, Jommelli, Conforto, and Corselli{—} varied when commissioned to write opera seria for the Iberian courts.The statistical analysis of fifteen settings especially written for the court theatres in Madrid and Lisbon, in comparison to the average data extracted from a corpus of 2,404 arias from 126 versions of a select number of Metastasian librettos, allows us to evaluate some particular usages regarding key, metre, tempo, and treatment of the vocal part. In this manner, through quantitative analysis, this article places eighteenth-century Iberian music production and consumption in the context of European opera seria, at the same time that it ultimately sets forth that its unique musical characteristics were also partly dependent on local musical customs, gender stereotypes, and personal idiosyncrasies alike.},

However, other parameters, including articulation, can play equally significant roles in the emergence and potential perception of musical structures. The processes of performance and inference are, moreover, so unique to each musician and/or beholder that revisions of traditional approaches to musical form have become necessary. To explore this phenomenon, I study both the score and five recordings of the finale from Brahms's first cello sonata, op. 38. The junctures where the transition and the recapitulation start are indeterminate. In addition, the piece employs procedures typical of both the sonata and the fugue to produce a formal hybrid that poses significant quandaries to both performers and analysts. Focusing on the selected musicians' manipulations of articulation, this article aims to determine whether this parameter might, along with timing and dynamics, be relevant in the emergence and perception of formal relations. The study also addresses the ways in which formal ambiguity can be materialized, concealed, and created in performance, ultimately investigating how musical form can, on the basis of its performance, be considered as multivalent.},

In this context, this article explores Pau Casals' intonational practice specific to his recording of Bach's E flat major prelude for solo cello. To do so, on the basis of exact empirical measurements, it places such practice alongside the cellist’s conscious, theoretical  recommendations  apropos  what  he  called  “expressive”  string  intonation,  showing  that  the  interpretation  of   the  latter  should  is  not  straightforward.  It  also  proposes  several  reference  points  and  tuning  systems  which  could  serve  as  models  for Casals' practice and looks for explanations beyond simple interval classification. In this manner, it ultimately proposes a structural function for intonation, in partnership with tempo and dynamics. Similarly, it understands Casals’ intonational practice not as a choice between but as a compromise for multiple options in tuning systems (mostly equal temperament and Pythagorean tuning), reference points (the fundamental note of  the chord and the immediately preceding tone), the nature of  the compositional materials (harmonic and melodic), and, most importantly, structure and expression.},

	abstract     = {Many musicians performing an ensemble work would aim to achieve good, if not perfect, synchronisation of timing for the sake of an effective rendition (McCaleb, 2014). In this respect, Pau Casals and Mieczyslaw Horszowski's 1935 recording of the second movement of Johannes Brahms's F major Cello Sonata, Op. 99, is certainly intriguing, as asynchronies between the two instruments are clearly perceptible throughout extensive passages. Questions concerning the rationale behind these temporal discrepancies arise: To what extent did Casals and Horszowski intend not to play together? In what ways can we understand these asynchronies? What are their musical effects? Analysis of timing that focused on the magnitude of the asynchronies as well as on tempo curves and durational patterns employed by the performers in this recording has shed light on the effects, purpose, and meaning of those asynchronies. This article illustrates that the temporal discrepancies between the cello and piano parts are neither the result of chance nor only local expressive devices; rather, they are critical elements in a highly distinctive construction of the Adagio Affettuoso from Brahms's Op. 99. They attest to an ongoing structural dialogue between the musicians that shapes and paces the piece in unexpected ways, prompting a reconsideration of ensemble playing as affording different, even conflicting attitudes. Furthermore, their potentially structural import leads to a critical broadening of the methods and parameters that music analysis has traditionally acknowledged. On these bases, a fruitful dialogue between music analysis and performance is put forward.},

Accounts of his manner of both playing and teaching, also refer to a “sense of proportion” which allegedly governed his use of rubato. Nevertheless, explanations thereof are vague and by no means clear. Furthermore, some of Casals' pedagogic principles {–}enunciation of the first note and the need for expressive variety{–} emerge as contradictory when observed from this perspective. To explore the practical employment of "rubato" and likewise to disclose the potentially structural meaning of this sense of proportion in Casals' performances, empirical analysis of tempo, beat duration, and agogic divergences between him and the pianist Horszowski will be undertaken, focusing on their recording of the second movement of "Brahms's Cello Sonata", Op. 99. In this manner, it will be possible to assess to what extent and in what ways the cellist's theoretical teachings were mirrored in his performance, and thus to understand better his particular style of playing.},

Early recordings offer, on the contrary, invaluable insights into pre-structuralist, approaches to musical form, as materialised in performance. Through the analysis of select renditions of the first movements of Brahms's cello sonatas{–}by Emmanuel Feuermann and Theo van der Pas (1934) and Pau Casals and Mieczyslaw Horszowski (1936){–}this chapter examines how timbre, intonation, and microtiming can also play a role in the creation, projection, and inference of structural relations. Taking the conclusions further, it ultimately exemplifies how the use of early recordings in contemporary research can contribute to general music theory by prompting a reconceptualisation of musical form as eminently constructed, diachronically contingent, and sound dependent, and of chamber music as unbalanced, potentially asynchronous practice.},

In this regard, we propose a novel feature extraction tool, named musif, and evaluate its efficacy on various repertoires and file formats, including MIDI, MusicXML, and **kern. Musif approximates existing tools such as jSymbolic and music21 in terms of computational efficiency while attempting to enhance the usability for custom feature development. The proposed tool also enhances classification accuracy when combined with other sets of features. We demonstrate the contribution of each set of features and the computational resources they require. Our findings indicate that the optimal tool for feature extraction is a combination of the best features from each tool rather than those of a single one. To facilitate future research in music information retrieval, we release the source code of the tool and benchmarks.},

	abstract     = {Musicology is a small discipline within the wide spectrum of human knowledge, yet it is already divided into various branches, each with its own societies, conferences, journals, jargons, degrees, prejudices, ..., and jobs. Although they share their object of investigation{–} "the art of music as a physical, psychological, aesthetic, and cultural phenomenon" {–}, these branches very often ignore one another. Research in musicology is mostly a solitary task, as investigations, papers, and publications are commonly signed by single authors, in contrast with STEM disciplines where teamwork is the rule. This is in part the result of tradition{–} the "Musico-logical Toolbox"  {–} but also the aftermath of the job market and financing programs.Large funding schemes such as the European Research Council (ERC) grants are becoming a major disruptive factor in many disciplines in the humanities, including musicology. Scholars in all fields now have the oppor-tunity  to  build  research  teams,  and  most  of  their  members  receive  their  salaries  to  exclusively  work  on  the  project. In other words, we are starting to build what could be called a Musicology Lab, learning along the way how teamwork is reshaping and transforming the Musicological Toolbox, the look and feel of our discipline, the way we work as well as the way we publish and disseminate our results.This paper presents some of the key features of the ERC Didone project, one of its principal tasks being to create  a  digitally  encoded  corpus  of  some  3,000  arias  in  MusicXML  format  from  about  180  musical  settings  of a small number of opera librettos by Pietro Metastasio. It focuses on some of the project’s research tasks, emphasizing how the skills of a team of eighteen scholars with very different expertise – historical musicology, music theory and analysis, cultural history, librettology, archival research, music performance, music engrav-ing, MIR, computer science, and statistical modeling – combine to explore the potential answer(s) to the main research question of the project: How are emotions expressed through music?},

	abstract     = {Some complex musical parameters might be especially difficult to understand for someone with no theoretical expertise in music. Musicians and music scholars alike normally evaluate such parameters visually by departing from scores, which present the musical events at once. Yet for the under-standing of such symbolic representations, musical training is essential, making scores mostly incomprehensible for amateurs. Data visualisation has been applied to meaningfully represent complex musical parameters, thus enabling music amateurs to grasp concepts such as texture or structure. Although scores are one of the "primary" sources to understand music, previous work shows a strong bias towards the visualisation of acoustic data, in detriment of the visualisation of symbolic information. To bridge the gap, we present SymPlot, a web-based open source tool to automatically visualise textural density, scoring, and structure from MusicXML files. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the topic, in this project we have applied the Scrum’s agile methodology, an iterative incremental approach specifically tailored for interdisciplinary projects. The tool, aimed at enhancing musical understanding in amateurs and students, as well as in scholars of other disciplines who need to incorporate music into their discourses, i.e., historians, philologists, etc., enables visualisation of local features at various hierarchical levels, highlighting similarities both within and across scores. Our evaluation of SymPlot {–}based on a five-level rating-scale test performed by 50 participants{–} suggests that colours increase' understanding of complex musical parameters.},
