	abstract     = {Variety in music performance has been deemed a natural necessity on the part of practitioners [Godlovitch, 1988; Margulis, 2014; Smith, 1993]. In fact, a strive for variety has been noticed both in terms of performative patterns that vary throughout a given interpretation [Rink, Spiro, and Gold 2011] and across the multiple performances of a given piece [Fabian 2015; Fabian and Ornoy 2009; Llorens 2018; 2021b; Ornoy 2008]. However, in most studies its discussion has been relegated to tangential commentaries, and very rarely has it been the focus of research. To fill this lacuna, this article investigates the interpretive techniques by which eighteen cellists create a sense of variety in a highly regular musical context: the Prelude from J. S. Bach's Suite for cello solo no. 4 in E flat major. The analysis addresses three main issues in each recording: a) the varying durational proportions between the various notes within each bar and the patterns that emerge from it; b) the importance of dynamics in supporting, compensating, or even overruling the effect of a); and c) the relatively unstable approaches to the intonation of specific intervals in the Prelude. Ultimately, this research contributes new case studies to the theorisation of variety in the context of pseudo-perpetual motion music, unequivocally positing performance as a critical element in music theory.}

	abstract     = {The historiography of musical interpretation has usually presented Andr{\'e}s Segovia and Julian Bream as opposed figures, as regards both their performance styles and their conceptions of the repertoire for the guitar. To that aim it has simply reproduced descriptions that overlook these musicians' sounds. In fact, it is no surprise that their recordings of Joaqu{\'i}n Rodrigo's Fantas{\'i}a para un gentilhombre {—}respectively from 1958 and 1987{—} bear witness to a different reality. Despite his exaggeration of the durational differences between the note values in some motifs, Segovia's agogic resources appear to respond to phraseological, metric, and harmonic preoccupations omitted in the literature. For his part, Bream, who becomes more irregular in constant-figuration passages, seems to adopt some techniques of historically informed performance. Through the analysis of the duration of notes, beats, sentences, and periods in both renditions, this case study demonstrates, thus, that a specific rendition may be the result of a complex web of motivations and influences. Ultimately, it exemplifies the necessity for the empirical analysis of musical performance in order to detect and understand the nuances that would otherwise remain silent.},

	abstract     = {The exceptional reception of Pietro Metastasio's works during the eighteenth century, all over Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula in particular, is well documented. Due to that unparalleled success, it is possible to ascertain Spain and Portugal's participation in international, contemporary  tastes  and  artistic  webs,  applicable  to  both  composers and  performers.  However,  this  internationalisation  needs  to  be  nuanced, as some characteristics of the repertoire specifically written for the Peninsula indicate that their court audiences may have had expectations, both social and strictly musical, different from those of the public in  opera  theatres  elsewhere  in  the  continent.  In  this  light,  this  article investigates in what ways the style of five composers in the international scene {—}Perez, Galuppi, Jommelli, Conforto, and Corselli{—} varied when commissioned to write opera seria for the Iberian courts.The statistical analysis of fifteen settings especially written for the court theatres in Madrid and Lisbon, in comparison to the average data extracted from a corpus of 2,404 arias from 126 versions of a select number of Metastasian librettos, allows us to evaluate some particular usages regarding key, metre, tempo, and treatment of the vocal part. In this manner, through quantitative analysis, this article places eighteenth-century Iberian music production and consumption in the context of European opera seria, at the same time that it ultimately sets forth that its unique musical characteristics were also partly dependent on local musical customs, gender stereotypes, and personal idiosyncrasies alike.},
