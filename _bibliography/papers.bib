	abstract     = {Variety in music performance has been deemed a natural necessity on the part of practitioners [Godlovitch, 1988; Margulis, 2014; Smith, 1993]. In fact, a strive for variety has been noticed both in terms of performative patterns that vary throughout a given interpretation [Rink, Spiro, and Gold 2011] and across the multiple performances of a given piece [Fabian 2015; Fabian and Ornoy 2009; Llorens 2018; 2021b; Ornoy 2008]. However, in most studies its discussion has been relegated to tangential commentaries, and very rarely has it been the focus of research. To fill this lacuna, this article investigates the interpretive techniques by which eighteen cellists create a sense of variety in a highly regular musical context: the Prelude from J. S. Bach's Suite for cello solo no. 4 in E flat major. The analysis addresses three main issues in each recording: a) the varying durational proportions between the various notes within each bar and the patterns that emerge from it; b) the importance of dynamics in supporting, compensating, or even overruling the effect of a); and c) the relatively unstable approaches to the intonation of specific intervals in the Prelude. Ultimately, this research contributes new case studies to the theorisation of variety in the context of pseudo-perpetual motion music, unequivocally positing performance as a critical element in music theory.}

To that aim it has simply reproduced descriptions that overlook these musicians' sounds. In fact, it is no surprise that their recordings of Joaqu{\'i}n Rodrigo's Fantas{\'i}a para un gentilhombre {—}respectively from 1958 and 1987{—} bear witness to a different reality. Despite his exaggeration of the durational differences between the note values in some motifs, Segovia's agogic resources appear to respond to phraseological, metric, and harmonic preoccupations omitted in the literature. For his part, Bream, who becomes more irregular in constant-figuration passages, seems to adopt some techniques of historically informed performance. Through the analysis of the duration of notes, beats, sentences, and periods in both renditions, this case study demonstrates, thus, that a specific rendition may be the result of a complex web of motivations and influences. Ultimately, it exemplifies the necessity for the empirical analysis of musical performance in order to detect and understand the nuances that would otherwise remain silent.},

Due to that unparalleled success, it is possible to ascertain Spain and Portugal's participation in international, contemporary  tastes  and  artistic  webs,  applicable  to  both  composers and  performers.  However,  this  internationalisation  needs  to  be  nuanced, as some characteristics of the repertoire specifically written for the Peninsula indicate that their court audiences may have had expectations, both social and strictly musical, different from those of the public in  opera  theatres  elsewhere  in  the  continent.  In  this  light,  this  article investigates in what ways the style of five composers in the international scene {—}Perez, Galuppi, Jommelli, Conforto, and Corselli{—} varied when commissioned to write opera seria for the Iberian courts.The statistical analysis of fifteen settings especially written for the court theatres in Madrid and Lisbon, in comparison to the average data extracted from a corpus of 2,404 arias from 126 versions of a select number of Metastasian librettos, allows us to evaluate some particular usages regarding key, metre, tempo, and treatment of the vocal part. In this manner, through quantitative analysis, this article places eighteenth-century Iberian music production and consumption in the context of European opera seria, at the same time that it ultimately sets forth that its unique musical characteristics were also partly dependent on local musical customs, gender stereotypes, and personal idiosyncrasies alike.},

However, other parameters, including articulation, can play equally significant roles in the emergence and potential perception of musical structures. The processes of performance and inference are, moreover, so unique to each musician and/or beholder that revisions of traditional approaches to musical form have become necessary. To explore this phenomenon, I study both the score and five recordings of the finale from Brahms's first cello sonata, op. 38. The junctures where the transition and the recapitulation start are indeterminate. In addition, the piece employs procedures typical of both the sonata and the fugue to produce a formal hybrid that poses significant quandaries to both performers and analysts. Focusing on the selected musicians' manipulations of articulation, this article aims to determine whether this parameter might, along with timing and dynamics, be relevant in the emergence and perception of formal relations. The study also addresses the ways in which formal ambiguity can be materialized, concealed, and created in performance, ultimately investigating how musical form can, on the basis of its performance, be considered as multivalent.},

In the field of music psychology and music perception,  such  explanations  have  been  explored  in  terms  of   interval  direction,  size,  or  type;  in  the  field  of  performance  analysis,  to  which  this  article  belongs, investigation on intonation has been not only scarce but also limited to short excerpts. In this context, this article explores Pau Casals' intonational practice specific to his recording of Bach's E flat major prelude for solo cello. To do so, on the basis of exact empirical measurements, it places such practice alongside the cellist’s conscious, theoretical  recommendations  apropos  what  he  called  “expressive”  string  intonation,  showing  that  the  interpretation  of   the  latter  should  is  not  straightforward.  It  also  proposes  several  reference  points  and  tuning  systems  which  could  serve  as  models  for Casals' practice and looks for explanations beyond simple interval classification. In this manner, it ultimately proposes a structural function for intonation, in partnership with tempo and dynamics. Similarly, it understands Casals’ intonational practice not as a choice between but as a compromise for multiple options in tuning systems (mostly equal temperament and Pythagorean tuning), reference points (the fundamental note of  the chord and the immediately preceding tone), the nature of  the compositional materials (harmonic and melodic), and, most importantly, structure and expression.},

	abstract     = {Many musicians performing an ensemble work would aim to achieve good, if not perfect, synchronisation of timing for the sake of an effective rendition (McCaleb, 2014). In this respect, Pau Casals and Mieczyslaw Horszowski's 1935 recording of the second movement of Johannes Brahms's F major Cello Sonata, Op. 99, is certainly intriguing, as asynchronies between the two instruments are clearly perceptible throughout extensive passages. Questions concerning the rationale behind these temporal discrepancies arise: To what extent did Casals and Horszowski intend not to play together? In what ways can we understand these asynchronies? What are their musical effects? Analysis of timing that focused on the magnitude of the asynchronies as well as on tempo curves and durational patterns employed by the performers in this recording has shed light on the effects, purpose, and meaning of those asynchronies. This article illustrates that the temporal discrepancies between the cello and piano parts are neither the result of chance nor only local expressive devices; rather, they are critical elements in a highly distinctive construction of the Adagio Affettuoso from Brahms's Op. 99. They attest to an ongoing structural dialogue between the musicians that shapes and paces the piece in unexpected ways, prompting a reconsideration of ensemble playing as affording different, even conflicting attitudes. Furthermore, their potentially structural import leads to a critical broadening of the methods and parameters that music analysis has traditionally acknowledged. On these bases, a fruitful dialogue between music analysis and performance is put forward.},

Accounts of his manner of both playing and teaching, also refer to a “sense of proportion” which allegedly governed his use of rubato. Nevertheless, explanations thereof are vague and by no means clear. Furthermore, some of Casals' pedagogic principles {–}enunciation of the first note and the need for expressive variety{–} emerge as contradictory when observed from this perspective. To explore the practical employment of "rubato" and likewise to disclose the potentially structural meaning of this sense of proportion in Casals' performances, empirical analysis of tempo, beat duration, and agogic divergences between him and the pianist Horszowski will be undertaken, focusing on their recording of the second movement of "Brahms's Cello Sonata", Op. 99. In this manner, it will be possible to assess to what extent and in what ways the cellist's theoretical teachings were mirrored in his performance, and thus to understand better his particular style of playing.},
