**Full title**: Researching and Encouraging the Promulgation of European Repertory through Technologies Operating on Records Interrelated Utilising Machines (Repertorium)

**Consortium**: University of Jaén, Odratek BV, The University of Oxford, Polytechnic University of Milan, Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales, Universidad Complutense Madrid, Tampere University, University of Alicante, Association Musicologie Médiévale, SPORK Digital, vist.co kulturmanagement GmbH, Asociación Hispana para el Estudio del Canto Gregoriano, Lithuanian National Philharmonic Society

**Description**: REPERTORIUM uses AI to digitise ancient and classical manuscripts, preserve European musical heritage, and create state-of-the-art sound processing technologies, including metaverse-ready immersive audio. These technologies are the foundation of a general musical artificial intelligence that fully unleashes the powers of machine learning upon the domain of European classical heritage, advancing us towards a human-centred digital world.
