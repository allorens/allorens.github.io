I hold a degree in History and Music Sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid (National Award for Academic Excellence, 2011) and a PhD in Music from the University of Cambridge (2018). I also graduated with Honors from the Royal Music Conservatory of Madrid (Violoncello performance) and pursued postgraduate performance studies at the Escuela Superior de Música Reina Sofía and Indiana University. Since March 2020, I held a "Juan de la Cierva–Formación fellowship from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, which was later followed by a "Juan de la Cierva–Incorporación" contract at the Complutense University of Madrid. As of December 2022, I am an Assistant Professor in Music Theory and Analysis in the Department of Musicology at the same institution.
